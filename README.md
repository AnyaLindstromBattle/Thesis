# Thesis

# This repository contains files required to run and analyze a stoichiometric model of Marchantia polymorpha modified for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), as explained in the thesis of Anya Lindstr√∂m Battle, Department of Biology, University of Oxofrd
# The files in this repository are as follows:
# - Functions.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing functions used to analyze the model
# - StreamlinedModel.ipynb: Jupyter notebook to build stoichiometric model of M. polymorpha metabolism 
# - Supplementary File 6 Cannell et al Marchantia.xml: Model of M. polymorpha built by Cannell et al (2020) and used as a starting point in this project
# - PHB_reactions.xlsx: Reactions to add to the model to allow for the production of PHB
# - Supplementary File 4 Cannell et al Python functions.py : ADD SOME FUNCTIONS FROM THIS TO OTHER
# - transferMets_Naomi_FUM.txt: A list of the transfer reactions to be added to the model
# - ServerSamplingv3.ipynb: Jupyter notebook used for flux sampling
# - Data from Corinna for constraints
# - R code for convergence analysis
