# Thesis

# This repository contains files required to run and analyze a stoichiometric model of Marchantia polymorpha modified for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), as explained in the thesis of Anya Lindstr√∂m Battle, Department of Biology, University of Oxofrd
#The files in this repository are as follows:
#- FinalFunctions.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing functions used to analyze the model
#- Marchantia_PHB_model.xml: Final model of M. polymoprha metabolism used in this project, in SBML format. 
#- Cannell_et_al_Marchantia_model.xml: Model of M. polymorpha built by Cannell et al (2021) and used as a starting point in this project
#- biomass_stoichiometry.csv: The biomass composition and component stoichiometry in the biomass equation, from Cannell et al (2021)
#- met+rxns_added_to_model.csv: Reactions added to better represent metabolism of Marchantia, from Cannell et al (2021)
#- PHB_reactions.csv: Reactions to add to the model to allow for the production of PHB
#- transferMets.txt: A list of the transfer reactions to be added to the model
#- DielOApattern.png: Data used for determination of carboxylic acid storage fluxes, generated by Corinna Hartinger, University of Oxford, UK
